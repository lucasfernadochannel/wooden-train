As the title and subtitle suggests, it's a project about a wooden train. I created it in a way that anyone can build. In this repository, there're two files and a folder full of photos. The **train-3D-model.f3d** file is a 3D model created on Fusion 360, as you can see on the image below. This model was important to determine the train measurements and how the pieces would fit with one another.

The **train-2D-drawings.dxf** file contains all the drawings that generated the 3D model (see the screenshot below). I sent this file to a laser cutting company. In this case, I ordered them to cut everything on MDF 3mm (0.12in).

You can see the length of any piece by opening this file and selecting the desired line with the **dimension tool**. If you are using Fusion 360, just type **D** and select the line.

I glued the wooden pieces with super glue and, when I finished assembling the train, I painted it with a dark brown craft paint. In the end, I applied a coat of varnish.

The train measures are:
  - Height: 113mm (4.45in)
  - Length: 304mm (11.97in)
  - Width: 86mm (3.39in)
